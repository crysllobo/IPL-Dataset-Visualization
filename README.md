# IPL Dataset Visualization

The Indian Premier League, or IPL, is a T20 cricket league, which was founded in 2008 and is held every year. It sees participation from both national and international players, and eight teams representing eight Indian cities compete with each other in a double round-robin format in the league stages, which are followed by playoffs. Over the years, IPL has become one of the most-watched and most attended live sporting events all over the world.

The Sports Editor of the agency has approached you to build a Tableau dashboard of IPL statistics over the years since its inception in order to create an infographic for a newsletter that their team is working on. For this newsletter, in some cases, they will use the visual representations as you have created in Tableau directly for their infographic. 

In order to complete the assignment, two data set files were used:

- matches.csv - It contains match-level information for each and every match held in IPL from 2008 to 2017.
- deliveries.csv - It contains ball-by-ball information for each of the matches.

The goal is to combine the datasets 'matches' and 'deliveries' to create an interactive dashboard in Tableau that highlights some of the important Match Statistics, Player Statistics and Team Statistics of IPL over the years 2008 - 2017.
